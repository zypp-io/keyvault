# Template repository
Template repository for Zypp projects. This can be used as an initial template when creating a project on GitHub. 
Not all folders have to be used when not needed, for example `data` or `docs` can be specific per project.

### How to use this template:
 1. When creating a new project on GitHub, you can choose a template project.
 2. When you cloned the repository, adjust the `setup.py` with your own name and email and the name of the project.
 3. Replace the name of the project in `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`.   
 4. Remove the folders you don't need.
 5. Optional: rename the `src` folder to the project name.
